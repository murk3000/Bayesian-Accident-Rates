# Bayesian Accident Rates in peak hours vs non-peak hours

The goal of this report is to compare the number of accidents in peak commute working hours vs non-peak
hours and see if there is a statistically significant difference between the two. This is done by using Bayesian
Inference and running a STAN model on two samples with the same conjugate prior. By demonstrating
two different parameter values, the method establishes that there was enough proof in the data to skew the
posterior in different directions.
